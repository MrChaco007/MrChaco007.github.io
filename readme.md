## Project Description
My project portfolio will mirror the style of a minimalist, Scandinavian interior design that mainly prioritizes function and utility over flare and extravagance. Each section will have a clear emphasis on what truly defines the makeup of that particular section, without adding irrelevant material or intrusive deadweight. The point of my portfolio will be to inform and enlighten, not overwhelm or distract.
