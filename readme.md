# Project Overview
## Project Schedule
I will be working on this project over the course of 10 weekdays, at a rate of 4 incredibly focused hours a day. 
|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1| Project Description | Complete
|Day 1| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeline | In progress
|Day 3| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Day 6| MVP & Bug Fixes | Incomplete
|Day 8| Final Touches | Incomplete
|Day 10| Record walk-through of website | Incomplete

## Project Description
My project portfolio will mirror the style of a minimalist, Scandinavian interior design that mainly prioritizes function and utility over flare and extravagance. Each section will have a clear emphasis on what truly defines the makeup of that particular section, without adding irrelevant material or intrusive deadweight. The point of my portfolio will be to inform and enlighten, not overwhelm or distract.

## Portfolio I want to Emulate
Search and compare at least 3 profile web sites.  Record your findings in the table below and include some aspect of the site that you would like to incorporate into your own site.
Link To Site  | One Thing I'd Like To Incorporate | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [https://samcasey.info/](https://samcasey.info/) | social media icons, color scheme/theme, competencies list
|[http://robertdiscipio.surge.sh/](http://robertdiscipio.surge.sh/) | competencies icons, flex display |
| [mattfarley.ca](http://mattfarley.ca/) |  simplicity, icons, color scheme

## Wireframes
Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

## Time/Priority Matrix 
[Link](https://res.cloudinary.com/jkeohan/image/upload/a_270/v1591621734/project1_matrix_ocy5gc_h1kg0m.jpg)
Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.  This involves drawing a a square.  In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line.  The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs.  This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete. 
Now draw a vertical line on the y axis.  The top of this line should have `High` and the bottom `Low`.  This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.  
Now create a separate list starting with A and assign it one of the features.  Continue to assign each feature a letter.  Once complete add each letter to the matrix assigning based on what your feel it's prioirty is an how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 2hrs to complete than break it down into smaller tasks and reassign them a new letter. 
Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo. 
 

#### MVP
- Pull data using Google JSON API 
- Render data on page's carousel
- Carousel
- Navbar
- Competencies icons
- Contact form
- Avatar
- Color scheme & fonts

#### PostMVP 
- When competencies icons are clicked on, the frameworks/libraries I know show up in a popover

## Functional Components
Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.
Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Hamburger | H | 1hr | hr |
| Project Previews | H | 3hr | hr |
| Regular Nav | H | 1hr | hr |  
| Adding contact form | H | 1.5hr|  hr | 
| Other sections and flex| H | 3hr | hr|
| Working with API | H | 6hr |  hr | 
| Responsive | H | 4hr | hr |
| CSS Grid | H | 2.5hr | hr | 
| Social Media Icons | H | 1hr |  hr |
| Carousel | H | 5hr |  hr |
| Total | H | 28 | hrs |

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Competencies Popover | H | 8hr | hr |
| Contact form responsive swap | H | 4hr | hr |
| Total | H | 12hrs| hrs |
